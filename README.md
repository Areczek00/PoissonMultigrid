This program solves a Poisson's equation â€” a partial differential equation. In this case (density equal to 0), the solution depends solely on Dirichlet boundary conditions, defined in void WB (double V[][ny+1]). The program requires python to be installed on your computer. If your OS is Windows, change line number 40 in Poisson.c to system("python plotf2.py"). Ensure that both files are in the same catalog.
